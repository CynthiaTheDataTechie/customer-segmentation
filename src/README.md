# Source Code (`src/`)

This folder contains reusable Python scripts for the project. These scripts are provided for modularity and can be used in other projects or for refactoring the notebook into a more structured pipeline. 

### Contents
- **`data_preprocessing.py`**: Functions for data cleaning and feature scaling.
- **`clustering.py`**: Functions for performing K-Means clustering and calculating metrics.
- **`visualization.py`**: Functions for visualizing clusters and analysis results.
- **`utils.py`**: Miscellaneous helper functions.

### Note
These scripts are not used directly in the Colab notebook. The code in the notebook is self-contained for simplicity. The `src` folder serves as a resource for modularizing the workflow or for collaborators who may want to reuse the code in other projects.
